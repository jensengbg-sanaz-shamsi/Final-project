        <h1>English Bulldog</h1>
        <article>
            <section>    
                <p>The English Bulldog breed is also commonly known by the names British Bulldog,
                    Bulldog, Churchill Dog.Bulldogs originally were used to drive cattle to market and to compete in a bloody sport called bullbaiting.
                    Today, they’re gentle companions who love kids. A brief walk and a nap on the sofa is 
                    just this dog breed‘s speed.</p>

                <p>You can’t mistake a Bulldog for any other breed. The loose skin of the head
                    , pushed-in nose, small ears,
                    and the distinctive rolling gait all practically scream “I’m a Bulldog!” The coat, seen in 
                    a variety of colors and patterns, is short, smooth, and glossy. Bulldogs can weigh up to
                    50 pounds, but that won’t stop them from curling up in your lap, or at least trying to.
                        But don’t mistake their easygoing ways for laziness—Bulldogs enjoy brisk walks and need
                        regular moderate exercise, along with a careful diet, to stay trim. Summer afternoons
                        are best spent in an air-conditioned room as a Bulldog’s short snout can cause labored 
                        breathing in hot and humid weather.</p>

                <p>Bulldog breed standards are 55 lb (25 kg) for a male and 50 lb (23 kg) for a female.In the 
                    United States, a typical mature male weighs 50 lb (23 kg), while mature females weigh about 40 lb (18 kg).
                    The Bulldog Club of America recommends the average weight of a bulldog to be 40–50 lb (18–23 kg).</p>
