                <p>The Toy Poodle is a small and lively domesticated dog, known for its thick,
                    tightly curled coat and enthusiastic nature. The Toy Poodle is a smaller variant 
                    of the Poodle, a water retriever hunting dog, officially adopted by the French but
                    believed to have originated in Germany. It was popularly used in the gun dog role
                    for duck hunters and paintings of the breed stretch back to the 15th and
                        16thCenturies.</p>

                <p>The Toy Poodle type is a very popular show dog and is just one of three official poodle
                    types. It’s believed that the Toy Poodle was developed in England by mating the
                    Standard Poodle with small terriers. Toy Poodle breeders first developed the breed
                    to find and dig up truffles, a common practice in England, Spain and France in the
                        1800s. Those that weren’t put to work ended up becoming the companion animals to
                        the aristocracy, and the true beginnings of the Poodle hair design tradition.</p>
