        <h1>Samoyed</h1>
        <article>
            <section>
                <p>The Samoyed is a friendly, personable dog. These are intelligent dogs, with a touch of 
                    independence. Bred to live in a tent in very close quarters with their families, they
                    thrive on human company. Samoyeds will alarm bark and, if left alone for long periods
                    of time, will often develop into nuisance barkers. Digging can be a problem because 
                    they dig to reach a cool resting place.Samoyeds tend to get along well with other dogs
                    as well as people and with other pets they are raised with. They are herding dogs and
                        may show some tendency to chase or nip. In general, they get along well with
                        children, although they can be a little boisterous for small toddlers.</p>

                <p>It may come as no surprise that the hardy, thick-coated Samoyed originates from Russia,
                    a country where frigid temperatures demand a well-insulated barrier against the cold.
                    Their name comes from the semi-nomadic Samoyede people of Siberia, who have relied 
                    on the breed for centuries for things like hunting, herding reindeer, pulling sleds, 
                    and snuggling for warmth on freezing Arctic nights. </p>

                <p>The Samoyed is a medium-sized dog with a height ranging from 19 to 23 1/2 inches and
                    weight from 50 to 65 pounds (23 to 29 kilograms).Samoyeds are squarely built,
                    sturdy dogs, with a fluffy plumed tail curled over the back and draped to one side.
                    The ears are prick and the head is broad. The corners of the lips curl up to give the
                    characteristic "Sammie smile." Samoyeds should have nice dark pigment around the eyes,
                    nose, and lips despite the white coat color.</p>
