        <h1>Some amazing facts about dogs you probably didn´t know!</h1>

                    <p>Dogs have a sense of time. It's been proven that they know the difference between
                        a hour and five. If conditioned to, they can predict future events, such as regular walk times.</p>
                    <p>Your dog is as smart as a two-year old! Ever wonder why children around this age seem to have a 
                        special bond with the family dog? It could be because they speak the same language, roughly 250
                        words and gestures in fact.</p>
                    <p>A study at UCSD claims that your dog can genuinely get jealous when they see you display affection
                        for another creature.</p> 
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>The United States has the highest pet dog population in the world. Approximately 75.8 million in
                    fact.</p>
                    <p>Seeing eye dogs are trained to do their “business” on command. This way their owner can clean
                        it up a bit easier. Some of the popular commands are “get busy” and “go time”.</p> 
                    <p>Your dog can smell your feelings. In fact, your dog’s sense of smell is approximately 100,000
                        times better than yours.So it shouldn’t be shocking that they can in fact, smell things such
                    as fear. When a human is fearful,they perspire, and a dog is easily able to pick up on this change.</p>

                    <p>Have you ever wondered why your dog curls up in a ball when they sleep? It’s actually
                        an age-old instinct to keep themselves warm and to protect vital organs while they sleep.</p> 
                    <p>Your dog can help get you a date! One study showed that a man’s chances of getting a girl’s
                        phone number went from 10% to 33%, just by having a dog with them. In the study, a staggering 
                        66% of men and women would not date someone who didn’t like pets.</p>
                    <p>Scientists believe that the world’s first known dog lived 31,700 years
                        ago. This prehistoric dog resembled a large Siberian Husky.</p>
